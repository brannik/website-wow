This is a registration page for Trinity Core utilizing SOAP.
It was made to play nicely with newly introduced RBAC system.
The page was designed by Pradox in 2010 (pradoxblog@gmail.com)
And adapted to utilize SOAP in 2013 by Chocochaos (me@chocochaos.com)

In order for this to work you will need to alter your php.ini file
and there please remove the ';' from the following lines:

;short_open_tag
;  Default Value: On
;  Development Value: Off
;  Production Value: Off

;extension=php_soap.dll

Be sure to enable SOAP in your Trinity Core world configuration and
edit the config.php to fit your configuration. The SOAP account has
to be GMlevel 4 (Console) in order to use the account create command.

If you need any support please ask for it in the appropriate thread.
Good luck, and have fun.

With kind regards,
Jeutie
